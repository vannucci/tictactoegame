# tictactoegame

You will always lose, or at best tie against this computer. This is an example tic-tac-toe game, guided from this example at FreeCodeCamp <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2TcQ3h0ipQ'>[YouTube]</a>. Using the minimax algorithm, we can ensure that the AI player will drill down and find the optimal move in any given board state. Here is a link to my <a href='#'>Github</a> code where I have worked on this.
  	<br>Start the game by clicking on any square you want, the first turn is always yours. A 'Replay' button will appear on top of the game board when the game is over.
